# <img src="https://www.chartjs.org/media/logo.svg" height="38" /> chartjs-java-model
Provides Java models for [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) so that e.g. a Java Server can build a chart and then instruct a JavaScript client what needs to be shown.

This repo extends the abandoned [Chart.java](https://github.com/mdewilde/chart) and adds support for Chart.js Version 4+.

> [!NOTE]
> We try our best to implement the ChartJS v4 API however there are a lot of configuration options.<br/>
> Therefore some parts migth still be missing or use the outdated v2 API from the original repo.<br/>
> If you think you found a missing or incorrect API please open an issue and/or provide a pull request.
